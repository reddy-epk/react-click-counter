This react project is about creating an **Click Counter**, so that we can keep a track about how many times we have clicked.
Note: It show's how the class Component actually works through Rendering each time when we update the state..

### It looks like:

<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/click-counter-output.gif" alt="click counter" style="max-width:70%;box-shadow:0 2.8px 2.2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)">
</div>
